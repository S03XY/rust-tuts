    // A variable can be used to store data or a pointer to a specific memory location in Rust.
    // Variables can be defined and initialized using the 'let' or 'const' keyword.
    // Variables are immutable by default and can be made mutable by adding the 'mut' keyword. 
    // (There is a smart pointer type that does not require explicit initialization with the 'mut' keyword, which will be discussed later.)

        Rust behaves differently for data stored in stack memory and data stored in heap memory, 
        as specified by ownership and borrow rules, which we will explore later.

    /*  PRO TIP:
        Whenever you write code in any language, keep memory in mind. Imagine memory as an address used to store something,
        like your home address. While most languages have garbage collectors, Rust uses an ownership model for memory management,
        providing more control to developers than garbage collectors. Memory is easy; just don't overreact!
        It will make things easier almost everywhere. ðŸ˜…

        Whenever you write code in any language, keep memory in mind. Imagine memory as an address used to store something,
        like your home address. While most languages have garbage collectors, Rust uses an ownership model for memory management,
        providing more control to developers than garbage collectors. Memory is easy; just don't overreact!
        It will make things easier almost everywhere. ðŸ˜…

/*
    When a program is executed, it has two types of memory: stack and heap.
    Working with stack memory is faster compared to heap memory because variables
    are stored in memory at compile time in an ordered manner, whereas data in heap memory
    is stored in an unordered manner. Therefore, the allocator needs to do some work to find a space
    to store a particular data and keep a book tracking it. That's why pushing data into
    stack memory is faster than allocating data in the heap.

    Ownership rules:
    1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
    2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    The data whose size can't be known at compile time is called dynamic data and is stored
    in heap memory, while the data whose size can be known at compile time is stored in stack memory.
    So when you reassign a variable to another variable, Rust first checks if the data is sized or unsized.
    If it is sized, Rust simply copies and pushes it onto the stack. If it's unsized data,
    Rust transfers the ownership to the new variable, and the other variable becomes invalid.

    Ownership can be transferred to other variables, functions, as return values from functions, threads, closures,
    and if you don't want to transfer ownership, you borrow. We'll look into that in the next segment.
*/

pub fn understand_ownership() {
    let a: u32 = 4;
    let b = a; // Its size is known at compile time, and hence it is copied and stored in the stack

    let unsized_data = String::from("ScriptSaga");
    let get_ownership = unsized_data; // This is unsized data, and then the ownership is transferred to a new variable, and unsized data is not valid anymore
}

// Understanding Rust Borrow Rules in Simpler Words

/*
    In simpler terms, borrowing in Rust simply means getting a reference to a variable.
    There are some borrow rules defined in Rust, but before that, just remember one
    thing very carefully:

    "The scope of a variable is defined from the line where the variable is first declared
    until it is no longer used. If it is not used, the scope is defined until the end. Also, the scope
    remains within a { } block, and if any value or variable is used inside a { },
    like
    {
        <some_variable_or_value> this value is always returned from the scope
    }
    "

    There are some borrow rules that the Rust borrow checker uses to prevent race conditions,
    as follows:

    1. At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    2. References must always be valid.
*/

pub fn understand_borrow_rules() {
    // Why do we borrow? -> We borrow when we don't want to transfer ownership.
    let mut arg1: String = String::from("follow_script_saga");

    // Multiple immutable borrows are allowed, which simply means you want to read the data.
    let immutable_borrow_arg1_first = &arg1;
    let immutable_borrow_arg1_second = &arg1;

    // Uncommenting the line below will give an error because the variable is borrowed
    // both mutably and immutably in the same scope of immutable_borrow_arg1_first.
    // let mutable_borrow_arg1 = &mut arg1;

    println!("{}", immutable_borrow_arg1_first);

    // Mutable borrowing is valid here because immutable_borrow_arg1_first is not in scope now.
    let mutable_borrow_arg1 = &mut arg1;

    // A borrowed reference can be given to a function as an argument or can be returned from a function,
    // but it requires an understanding of lifetimes, which is beyond the scope of this example.
}
